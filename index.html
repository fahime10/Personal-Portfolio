                    Through my Computer Science degree, I have learnt many concepts about coding and 
                    creating apps and websites that are aesthetically pleasing.
                    I am following the course The Odin Project to help me learn JavaScript.
                    At university, I have learnt various languages such as Java, PHP, JavaScript and so on.
                    I was also taught to work in team through an Agile methodology as the industry, most often, has different teams
                    working on frontend or backend.

                <h4>Waterflow Project: Final Year at university</h4>
                <p>
                    This was my final year project at university.
                    It is a website that uses a database (MariaDB) to store users' details, projects and tasks.
                    The backend uses PHP with the Slim framework. JavaScript is also used to handle the frontend.
                    The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/fahime10/Waterflow-Final-Year-Project">here</a>.

                <h4>PHP Telemetry Web App</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was done using an Agile approach. I was in a team of three and we all had different
                    parts to complete. I was handling the database part, mainly storing messages that
                    are stored in the M2M server, login and register processes.
                    Unfortunately, the repository is private due to sensitive information.

                <h4>Mobile App Survey</h4>
                <p>
                    This project involved the use of Kotlin to develop a survey maker on the phone.
                    It also uses SQLite as the database to store user information, questions and answers.
                    The app allows admins to create surveys, and students to answer questions.
                    Based on answers, the admin is able to view a table with statistics about the answers,
                    and also view a pie chart.

                <h4>JavaFX university assignment</h4>
                <p>
                    This project involved the use of Java and utilises JavaFX to produce graphical outputs.
                    The purpose of the app was to simulate a module chooser for students who needed to select final 
                    year modules.
                    The app allows the student to sign in on the first page, then select modules for both first and 
                    second term (there is a limit based on credits).
                    Students must also pick reserve modules on the third page. 
                    On the fourth page is the summary of the student's details, the first choice modules and reserve modules.
